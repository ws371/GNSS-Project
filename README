#The main objective of this project is to make a practical system that can sense the GPS jamming using the values of different frequency bands (L1, L2, L5), SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), and the coordinates derived from NMEA Sentences, which are the potential causing of the jamming with the help of machine learning algorithms. 
#The implemented machine learning models are Random Forest classification and K-Nearest Neighbors. These models are trained using the data from tests done in Norway. The training data consists of SNR values, distance to the jammer, and other modifications of those features, which allow the model to learn and detect jamming events. 
#The system gathers GPS data including coordinates (latitude, longitude, and altitude) and SNR readings from the three main GPS frequency bands (L1, L2, and L5) GPS satel-lites employ these frequency ranges for the signal transmission, and tracking the SNR throughout these bands yields important information on signal integrity. 
#The system finds the distance between the GPS receiver and a known jammer location. This feature is critical for understanding how proximity to a jammer influences SNR levels. By combining the distance to jammer with the SNR values, the system can iden-tify patterns of interference that are characteristic of jamming.
